INTRODUCTION

This is a simple example for ZMQ's push-pull sockets in python. The application consists of a producer and consumer. 
The producer generates events that are pushed to the consumers connected to it.
The consumers pull the events created by the producer, and diplay them.
The producer uses a round-robin approach to distribute the events with all the consumers.

PRE-REQUISITES

In order to run this application, the latest stable version of ZeroMQ along with the python language bindings need to be installed 
in all the machines deploying this application. The full instructions for installation can be found in:

ZeroMQ

Python-ZeroMQ bindings:
http://zeromq.org/bindings:python

DEPLOYMENT

To deploy this application:-

1. Launch the producer either as:-
	
		python producer.py <port_no>				(assuming the host is localhost)
		
	OR
		python producer.py <host_name> <port_no>
		
2. Once the producer is live, launch the subscriber either as:-
		
		python consumer.py <port_no>				(assuming the host is localhost)
		
	OR
		python consumer.py <host_name> <port_no>
		
	Multiple consumers can pull from the same producer. To observe the round robin distribution, launch multiple consumers.
