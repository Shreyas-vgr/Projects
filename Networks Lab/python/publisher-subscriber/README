INTRODUCTION

This is an example for an application of ZMQ's publisher-subscriber sockets in python. The application provides weather service
where the server continuously generates the current temperatures for a given set of cities. The subscriber can subscribe to receive the weather
updates of one city. The subscriber application finally computes the mean temperature based on 5 readings from the weather server.

However, the client first needs to check if the desired city exists, so it first sends a request to the city check server (using request-reply)
if the given city exists in the weather server. If it does, then the client subscribes to that city with weather server.
Otherwise this city check service suggests a list of other cities that client could subscribe to.

All the cities are read from the in_cities.txt file located in the servers' context.

PRE-REQUISITES

In order to run this application, the latest stable version of ZeroMQ along with the python language bindings need to be installed 
in all the machines deploying this application. The full instructions for installation can be found in:

ZeroMQ

Python-ZeroMQ bindings:

DEPLOYMENT

To deploy this application:-

1. Launch the check city request-reply server either as:-
	
		python city_check_server.py <port_no>				(assuming the host is localhost)
		
	OR
		python city_check_server.py <host_name> <port_no>
		
2. Then launch the weather publisher service either as:-
		
		python weather_server.py <port_no>				(assuming the host is localhost)
		
	OR
		python weather_server.py <host_name> <port_no>
		
3. Then launch the client which will take a city name as input from STDIN and then subscribe, if the city exists

		python weather_client.py <city_check_host_name> <city_check_port_no> <subscriber_host_name> <subscriber_port_no>
